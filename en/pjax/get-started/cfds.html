Margin level is the ratio of equity to margin. When that ratio reaches a specified percentage (usually 100%), your account will be placed under margin call. This does not affect your ability to open new positions; it serves to alert you that your floating PnL is moving lower. However, it is recommended to add funds to your account in order to keep your positions open. Alternatively, you may close losing positions.</p><div class="gr-padding-10"><div class="separator-line  "></div></div><h3 class="secondary-color">What&#x27;s a stop out level and how is it applied</h3><p>If your margin level reaches an even lower level (usually 50%), it will reach the stop out level where it is unable to sustain an open position. This will lead to some, or all your open positions being forcibly closed (also known as &quot;forced liquidation&quot;).</p><p>When your account hits the forced liquidation level, your orders and positions are forcibly closed in the following sequence:</p><ol><li>We delete an order with the largest margin reserved</li><li>If your margin level is still under the stop out level, your next order will be deleted. However, orders without margin requirements will not be deleted</li><li>If your margin level is still under the stop out level, we will close an open position with the largest loss</li><li>We will continue to close open positions until your margin level becomes higher than the stop out level</li></ol></div><div class="sections invisible" id="contract-specification"><h2 class="primary-color">CFD contract specifications</h2><div class="gr-padding-10"><div class="separator-line  "></div></div><h3 class="secondary-color">Cash Indices</h3><div class="table-container"><table><thead><tr><th class="gr-padding-10">Symbol</th><th class="gr-padding-10">Description</th><th class="gr-padding-10">Lot size</th><th class="gr-padding-10 w-80">Minimum volume</th><th class="gr-padding-10 w-80">Volume step</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>AUS_200</td><td>Australia 200 Cash Index</td><td>AUD 1 per point</td><td>1</td><td>0.10</td></tr><tr><td>DAX_30</td><td>Germany 30 Cash Index</td><td>EUR 1 per point</td><td>1</td><td>0.10</td></tr><tr><td>ESP_35</td><td>Spain 35 Cash Index</td><td>EUR 1 per point</td><td>1</td><td>0.10</td></tr><tr><td>EUR_50</td><td>Euro 50 Cash Index</td><td>EUR 1 per point</td><td>1</td><td>0.10</td></tr><tr><td>FRA_40</td><td>France 40 Cash Index</td><td>EUR 1 per point</td><td>1</td><td>0.10</td></tr><tr><td>GBR_100</td><td>UK 100 Cash Index</td><td>GBP 1 per point</td><td>1</td><td>0.10</td></tr><tr><td>JP_225</td><td>Japan 225 Cash Index</td><td>JPY 1 per point</td><td>1</td><td>0.10</td></tr><tr><td>NED_25</td><td>Netherlands 25 Cash Index</td><td>EUR 1 per point</td><td>1</td><td>0.10</td></tr><tr><td>US_30</td><td>US 30 Cash Index</td><td>USD 1 per point</td><td>1</td><td>0.10</td></tr><tr><td>US_100</td><td>US 100 Cash Index</td><td>USD 1 per point</td><td>1</td><td>0.10</td></tr><tr><td>US_500</td><td>US 500 Cash Index</td><td>USD 1 per point</td><td>1</td><td>0.10</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="gr-padding-10"><div class="separator-line  "></div></div><h3 class="secondary-color">Volatility Indices</h3><div class="table-container"><table><thead><tr><th class="gr-padding-10">Symbol</th><th class="gr-padding-10">Lot size</th><th class="gr-padding-10 w-80">Minimum volume</th><th class="gr-padding-10 w-80">Volume step</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Volatility 10 Index</td><td>USD 1 per point</td><td>0.10</td><td>0.01</td></tr><tr><td>Volatility 25 Index</td><td>USD 1 per point</td><td>0.50</td><td>0.01</td></tr><tr><td>Volatility 50 Index</td><td>USD 1 per point</td><td>0.50</td><td>0.01</td></tr><tr><td>Volatility 75 Index</td><td>USD 1 per point</td><td>0.01</td><td>0.01</td></tr><tr><td>Volatility 100 Index</td><td>USD 1 per point</td><td>0.01</td><td>0.01</td></tr><tr><td>HF Volatility 10 Index</td><td>USD 1 per point</td><td>0.10</td><td>0.01</td></tr><tr><td>HF Volatility 50 Index</td><td>USD 1 per point</td><td>0.50</td><td>0.01</td></tr><tr><td>HF Volatility 100 Index</td><td>USD 1 per point</td><td>0.30</td><td>0.01</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="gr-padding-10"><div class="separator-line  "></div></div><h3 class="secondary-color">How to read the table above</h3><p>A Contract for Difference (CFD) is a financial derivative that allows you to profit by speculating on the rise or fall of an underlying asset.
