Options trading can become a real addiction, as can any other activity pushed to its limits. We kindly ask you to engage in a careful self-analysis to check if you are at risk. To avoid the danger of such an addiction, it is important that you follow some basic principles and guidelines.</p><ol><li>Use the opportunity provided by our website to practice for free with our virtual money account facility. This will enable you to get used to the functionalities and rules of the website.</li><li>Do not trade more than you can afford.</li><li>Do not trade when you are tired or are under the influence of alcohol.</li><li>Put a limit on your winnings.
