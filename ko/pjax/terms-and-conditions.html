Clients should note that the different markets may close at different times during the day due to local trading hours and time zones.</p><p>In the case of single stock and stock index prices, the final closing price as reported by the relevant official Exchange shall apply for all settlements (this final settlement price may, at times, be reported by the relevant Exchange 30-90 minutes after the official closing time of the market, and may differ from the latest tick price that occurred at the closing time).</p><p>For forex quotes the closing times are defined by the Company as shown in the Market Opening Times section of the website. In the event of any dispute regarding market or settlement values, the decision of the Company shall be final and binding. Clients should note that certain markets (such as stocks and stock indices) are not open throughout the day and that trading may not be available when the markets are closed.</p><p>The calculation of the price to be paid (or the payout to be received) for financial contracts on this site at the time the financial contract is purchased or sold will be based on the Company&#x27;s best estimate of market price movements and the expected level of interest rates, implied volatilities and other market conditions during the life of the financial contract, and is based on complex mathematics. The calculation will include a bias in favour of the Company. The financial contract prices (or the payout amounts) offered to Clients speculating on market or index prices may differ substantially from prices available in the primary markets where stock indices or commodities or contracts thereupon are traded, due to the bias favouring the Company in the price calculation system referred to above.</p><p>The charting data made available to Clients by the Company is indicative only and may at times differ from the real market values. The Company&#x27;s decision as to the calculation of a financial contract price will be final and binding. The Company allows the option to sell contracts before expiry time of some contracts but will not be obliged to do so and can suspend this option depending on the current market conditions. Contracts may be amended when the underlying asset value is adjusted by corporate actions during the contract period.</p><p>Should a disruption occur in the data feeds which cannot be readily rectified by the Company, the Company reserves the right to refund the contract purchase.</p><h2 data-anchor="true">Trading Limits</h2><p>The Company reserves the right to have in place risk limits, which affects the trading limits of all clients trading, and may not be limited solely to instruments and contract types.</p><p>The Company may also impose volume trading limits on Client accounts at its sole discretion.

Retail Clients benefit from the highest degree of protection.</p><p>Unless otherwise advised, we shall treat you as a Retail Client. You may also request, in writing, us to change the category in which you have been classified and this may have an effect on the level of protection afforded to you. Professional Clients do not fall within the scope of the Investor Compensation Scheme. We reserve the right to accept or refuse any such request for change in classification.</p><p>Notwithstanding the above, you hereby declare that you are dealing with us outside the scope of your economic or professional activity and we will therefore treat you as an individual retail client for the purposes of EMIR compliance, unless advised otherwise.</p><p>We are entitled under the Rules to rely upon information provided by you.

These contracts accordingly are not instruments that we hold on your behalf and neither benefit from clients&#x27; assets protection in the event of our insolvency.

The Scheme is based on EC Directive 97/9.</p><p>Cover is made available on the basis of the depositor rather than on the basis of the number of deposits, meaning that if an individual has multiple accounts he will only be covered as to €20,000 on the global amount.

Orders</h2><ol><li>Order Execution/Cancellation/Modification<ol><li>You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to understand the features, characteristics, terms and conditions of an Order and the implications of executing an Order before you place an Order with us.</li><li>Subject to network latency, we endeavour to execute your Order within a reasonable time from the time you triggered the Order, at the Price nearest to your specified Price. We do not guarantee that a Transaction will be opened/closed following an Order being triggered by you at your specified Price.</li><li>We endeavour to open or close the Transaction to which your Order relates at the price reasonably available to us, acting in accordance with our duty of best execution. Best execution means that we must take all sufficient steps to obtain, when executing orders, the best possible result for you, taking into account the price, costs, speed, likelihood of execution and settlement, size, nature, or any other consideration relevant to the execution of the order.</li><li>Our Prices are determined by reference to the price of the underlying instrument which is quoted on external exchanges or dealing facilities that we select at our discretion. Our IT infrastructure and price aggregator system facilitates the reception of quotes from shortlisted prime brokers who act as liquidity providers for us and the delivery of the quotes, derived with reference against relevant benchmark and markets, to you. You acknowledge that our Prices may differ from the bid and offer prices made available by external exchanges or dealing facilities and we are not liable for any losses that you incur arising from such differences. This clause does not apply to Volatility Indices.</li></ol></li><li>Stop and Limit Orders<ol><li>We may, at our absolute discretion, accept a Stop Order or a Limit Order from you. We may enable other types of Orders (for example, a trailing stop order) for your execution at any point in time.</li><li>You may specify your instruction of a Stop Order or a Limit Order may be applied for a limited duration or for an indefinite period (a &quot;good till cancelled&quot; or &quot;GTC&quot; Order).</li><li>In the case of a Stop Order, you acknowledge that we will endeavour to open/close a Transaction at the Next Available Price.</li><li>In the case of a Limit Order, you acknowledge that we will endeavour to open/close a Transaction at a level that is the same or better than the Limit you specified, subject to the availability of the Limit Price. You acknowledge that at the time of order execution, our bid/offer price may become less favourable to you.</li><li>You may not cancel or amend the level of your Stop and Limit Order prior to the closing of your Transaction once the level has been reached.</li><li>You acknowledge that a Stop or Limit Order placed on your Open Position, when executed, would be capable of closing or partly closing your Transaction. You also acknowledge that it is your responsibility to cancel the Stop or Limit Order that you placed on your Open Positions if you do not want the Stop or Limit Order to remain valid. If you close your original Transaction and fail to cancel the Stop or Limit Order, we shall be entitled, at our absolute discretion, to treat the Stop or Limit Order as an instruction to enter into a new Transaction for you if and when our quote reaches or goes beyond the level of the Stop or Limit Order.</li><li>You acknowledge that we reserve the right to establish a minimum and maximum transaction size which may be subject to alteration and that we will only execute Orders that fall within the range of the minimum and maximum transaction size.</li><li>We may, at our absolute discretion, disregard your Order if an Event takes place resulting in it no longer being reasonable for us to act on your Order after indicating an acceptance of your Order.</li></ol></li></ol><h2 data-anchor="true">G. Margin</h2><ol><li>일반규정<ol><li>Prior to placing an Order which results in opening a Transaction or increasing an existing Open Position, you acknowledge that it is your responsibility to ensure that your Account&#x27;s Free Margin is sufficient to cover the Margin required in relation to the open Transaction (the &quot;Margin Requirement&quot;), and to continuously meet the Margin Requirement.</li><li>Throughout the duration of the Transaction and for as long as the Transaction is open, you are required to maintain a sufficient Account Equity to cover any Margin Requirement. If your Account Equity is less than the Margin Requirement in relation to the open Transaction you wish to create, you have entered into a Margin Call and you are required to fund the shortfall immediately. You may not be able to place an Order to open a Transaction until the shortfall has been funded and there is sufficient Account Equity to cover the Total Margin.</li><li>You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to monitor your Account Balance and Margin Requirement and we are not under any obligation to keep you informed (i.e., to make a Margin Call).</li></ol></li><li>Margin Requirement and Calculation<ol><li>The Margin Requirement is a percentage of the value of the Open Positions and will continue to fluctuate in accordance with the value of the Open Positions throughout the duration of the relevant contracts (the &quot;Contract Value&quot;).</li><li>Margin Requirements can increase/decrease based on the aggregated size of your Open Position determined by the volume (number of lots), contract size (value per point in the original currency of the contract), market price, and margin rate.</li><li>We may modify Margin Requirements for any Open Positions or new Transactions entered into, at our sole discretion. Formulas for Margin Requirements published on the website are indicative only and may be changed by the Company at its discretion at any time, due to changing market conditions or other factors.</li><li>Whilst we endeavour to close out your Open Positions if and when the Margin Level for your MT5 Real Account reaches or falls below the Stop Out Level, we do not guarantee that your Open Positions will be closed when the Margin Level for your MT5 Real Account reaches the Stop Out Level.</li><li>For perfectly hedged positions, no margin will be charged. However, swaps and other applicable fees can cause your Account Equity to turn negative. In such cases, the company reserves the right to close out your hedged positions in order to protect your Account Equity from decreasing further.</li></ol></li><li>Stop Out Level<ol><li>If the Margin Level for your MT5 Real Account reaches or falls below the Stop Out Level, this will be classified as an Event of Default. In such circumstances, Open Positions are automatically closed in the following order: (i) the server analyses clients&#x27; Orders that are not under execution at the moment; (ii) the server deletes Orders with the largest Margin; (iii) if your Margin Level is still under the Stop Out Level, the next order is deleted (orders without margin requirements are not deleted); (iv) if your Margin Level is still under the Stop Out Level, the server closes a position with the largest loss; (v) Open Positions are closed until your Margin Level becomes higher than the Stop Out Level.</li><li>The default Stop Out Level applicable to your Account is published on our website. However, the default Stop Out Level is subject to alteration at our absolute discretion. Any changes to the Stop Out Level will take effect immediately. We will endeavour to notify you of an alteration to the default Stop Out Level by publishing the revised default Stop Out Level on our website. It is your responsibility to check our website regularly and remain informed about the default Stop Out Level.</li><li>The Stop Out Level applicable to your MT5 Real Account may differ from the default Stop Out Level published on our website.</li></ol></li><li>Negative Balance Protection<ol><li>The Company has a Stop Out policy which prevents you from losing more than you have deposited. However, in the event that your Open Positions are not closed when the Margin Level for your MT5 Real Account reaches the Stop Out Level, the Company, at its sole discretion, may waive your negative balance by crediting your account if your Account Balance goes into a negative balance. The negative balance is determined by aggregating all the negative balances incurred over a 24-hour period across all accounts held by you. You acknowledge that the offer of the Negative Balance protection by the Company to you is at the Company’s sole discretion and we reserve the right to change the features and eligibility criteria of the Negative Balance Protection at any time. The provisions of the Negative Balance Protection do not apply:<ol><li>in the case of a force majeure event;</li><li>in abnormal market conditions or exceptional market movements/volatility;</li><li>in the case of a client opening any Transaction in relation to Prohibited Trades;</li><li>in the case of Professional Clients;</li><li>where the negative balance is connected to or a result of functional limitations and/or malfunction of the MT5 Trading Platform; and</li><li>in the case of a client breaching any of the terms of this Agreement which results in a negative balance.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Margin Payment<ol><li>You may make Margin Payments by transferring funds from your Binary Options Real Account to your MT5 Real Account.

This smoothing algorithm removes a little of the &quot;random noise&quot; surrounding the data feed, and ensures that clients who buy path-dependent contracts (such as the one-touch or barrier-range contracts) will not have their contracts knocked-in or knocked-out by random short-term market noise that does not reflect the true market price.</p><h2 data-anchor="true">다른 데이터 피드들과의 차이점</h2><p>저희의 데이터 피드는 떄떄로 인터넷에서 찾을 수 있는 타 데이터 피드들(서로 차이점을 나타내는 데이터 피드)과 비교할 때 어느정도 차이점이 있을 수 있습니다. 피드 제공자들 사이에서 있는 차이점은 이러한 이유들을 포함하고 있습니다:</p><ul><li>For forex: The forex market is an OTC (over the counter) market, where banks and other major financial institutions trade currencies amongst themselves without there being any central clearing house. Accordingly, there is no &#x27;official&#x27; price source for forex quotes. Different data feeds will contain quotes from a different sub-set of international banks. Accordingly prices may differ between providers, depending on which bank(s) they obtain prices from.</li><li>The smoothing and filtering algorithms described above.</li><li>Market-closing times: Please refer to <a href="/binary-static/ko/resources/market_timesws.html">거래 시간</a> page for the exact time of settlement for all contracts. Other websites may adopt a different convention (for example some websites choose 4 o&#x27;clock NY time, or 5 o&#x27;clock London time). As a result, the open, high, low and closing prices displayed on our website may differ to those on other websites, due to the market-closing time convention.</li><li>Use of bid/ask prices: when the market is illiquid, the data feed may contain many bid and ask prices, without there actually being any traded price for quite a while. By taking an average of the bid/ask price (i.e. bid + ask, divided by 2), a market quote is generated that reflects the current market, without it actually being a traded price. Our system will generate prices from these bid and ask prices, whereas other websites might not. As a result, our website might display ticks that do not appear in the data feeds of other websites.</li></ul><p>저희의 데이터 피드는 거래환경에 있어 가장 탄탄하며 최고의 수준으로 디자인되었습니다.</p><h2 data-anchor="true">주말 할당</h2><p>주말 할당에 대해서는 계약 설정의 목적에 따라 무시해 주시기 바랍니다. 주말동안, 떄때로 외환 시장이 가격을 형성할 수 있습니다. 하지만 이러한 가격들은 종종 인위적입니다(트레이더들은 종종 이러한 시장의 비유동성으로 가격을 올리거나 내리는 이점을 이용합니다). 이러한 인위적 가격들로 인해 가격이 형성되는 것을 방지하기 위해 계약 설정 가치에 있어 주말 가격을 포함하지 않는 것은 Binary.com의 규칙입니다 (주말에 열리는 변동성 지수에 대해서는 제외합니다).</p></div></div><div id="privacy-content" class="toggle-content invisible"><div><h2 data-anchor="true">보안 및 개인정보 보호</h2><p>We recognize the importance of protecting your personal and financial information.</p><p>The personal information that we obtain about you assists us in servicing your account.

Therefore, trading in Binary Options is appropriate only for persons that understand and are willing to assume the economic, legal and other risks involved in such transactions. You should be satisfied that Binary Options trading is suitable for you in light of your investment circumstances and attitude towards risk before trading. You should not engage in speculative Binary Options trading unless you understand the basic aspects of such trading and its risks. If you are in any doubt as to whether Binary Option trading is appropriate and suitable for you, please seek independent advice from a investment consulting professional. Binary.com does not provide such advice. It is your responsibility, taking into account your personal circumstances and investment resources, to take particular care and make careful considerations independently, both prior to applying to engage in Binary Options with Binary.com, as well as prior to making any individual order. Where you do not understand the risks involved in applying for a trading account with Binary.com or in making any individual order, you should seek advice and consultation from an independent investment advisor. If you continue to not understand the risks involved in trading in Binary Options, you should not trade at all.</p><p>You are advised that the Binary Options offered by Binary.com are not traded under the rules of any recognised, designated or regulated exchange.

If you deposit funds in a currency to trade Contracts denominated in a different currency, your gains or losses on the underlying investment therefore may be affected by changes in the exchange rate between the currencies.</p><p><strong>Other Risks</strong>: There are other risks that relate to trading investment products and trading foreign currencies that cannot be described in detail in this document. Generally, however, securities, options and currency transactions involve exposure to a combination of the following risk factors: market risk, credit risk, settlement risk, liquidity risk, operational risk and legal risk. For example, there can be serious market disruptions if economic or political or other unforeseen events locally or overseas affect the market.

Its objective is rather to provide you with information for you to reasonably understand the risks associated with forex and contracts for differences offered by Binary.com in our interest to provide you with the best possible trading experience.</p><h2 data-anchor="true">Forex and contracts for differences are high risk and speculative</h2><p>Forex and contract for differences transactions involve a high degree of risk and are speculative because they allow you to speculate on the short term movements of the price of the underlying financial instruments. You should not enter into forex and/or contracts for differences transactions unless you are able to sustain losses that exceed your deposited funds. It is important for you to understand that in order to realise any value from your open positions, you would have to enter into a corresponding transaction to close your open positions and you may find it difficult or impossible to do so under certain market conditions.</p><h2 data-anchor="true">Execution model and counterparty risk</h2><p>Binary.com offers forex and contracts for differences via the hybrid model, i.e., both dealing on own account (dealing desk) and partially hedging client orders with our liquidity providers (no-dealing desk). Client orders are typically hedged when the total transaction volume exceeds a predefined threshold of risk tolerance level. For both execution models, Binary.com acts as the contractual counterparty to the transactions that you enter into with us, as opposed to entering into a contractual counterparty with a central clearing house as would be the case with exchange traded financial instruments. As such, counterparty risk exists. Counterparty risk refers to the risk of loss for clients resulting from the fact that the counterparty to the forex and/or contracts for differences transaction that you entered into may default on its obligations prior to the final settlement of the transaction&#x27;s cash flow.</p><h2 data-anchor="true">Leverage</h2><p>Leverage, in the context of margin trading, refers to the use of margin to increase/amplify the value of a trade. Leverage is expressed as a ratio. A 50:1 leverage, for example, means that you would be able to enter into a trade position that is of 50 times higher than your margin. When you invest in a leveraged product, your profit or loss is based on the leveraged position, i.e., the increased/amplified value of your trade determined based on the leverage ratio you set for your account.</p><p>Leverage can be used to generate returns that are of multiple times higher than the amount set aside from your account balance to open and maintain a transaction (your margin). However, investments that have the potential to deliver greater investment returns carry higher levels of risk. This means that if the price movement is against your favour, you will suffer losses that are of multiple times higher than the amount set aside from your account balance to open and maintain a transaction (your margin).</p><h2 data-anchor="true">Relationship between Margin and Leverage</h2><p>The leverage ratio refers to the number of times your margin (the amount set aside from your account balance to open and maintain a transaction) can be &quot;leveraged&quot; to enter into a Transaction. The denominator of the leverage ratio is always 1. A 50:1 leverage is equivalent to a 2% margin requirement (1 divided by 50 = 2%). The leverage ratio that we/you establish will determine the amount of margin required. As leverage is inversely proportional to margin, the lower the leverage you set for your Account, the higher the margin required to be set aside from your account balance (your margin requirement).</p><h2 data-anchor="true">Risk of Stop Order</h2><p>The system fills orders on a first-in-first out basis, i.e. based on the sequence of the order received, and this is beyond our control. As a result, you may find it difficult or impossible to close a position at the intended price stipulated in your Stop Order during certain market conditions. The placement of Stop Order by you, though useful as a risk management tool, will not necessarily limit your losses to your intended amounts, in the event of highly volatile trading conditions, since market conditions may make it impossible to execute such orders and there is uncertainty about your possible exit price. In short, a Stop Order is not guaranteed because it cannot operate whatever the market circumstances are.</p><h2 data-anchor="true">Regular monitoring of open positions</h2><p>Trading forex and contracts for differences carries a high level of risk and Binary.com does not monitor the open positions of your account on your behalf. It is your responsibility to monitor your Open Positions and understand the exposure of your Open Positions whilst ensuring that your exposure commensurate with your risk appetite. Due to the cost associated with overnight open positions, you should consider investing in the market of the instrument in which you ordinarily transact in instead of investing in a CFD.</p><h2 data-anchor="true">Risk of slippage</h2><p>Whilst we endeavour to open or close the Transaction to which your orders relate at the requested price, acting in accordance with our duty of best execution, there are times when, due to an increase in volatility or volume, orders may be subject to slippage. The difference between the order price and execution price when orders are filled is known as slippage. This means that your order is not filled at the exact intended quoted price when you placed your order. Slippage is usually seen during periods of extremely high or low volatility and generally occurs during fundamental news releases or periods of limited liquidity. Slippages can result in either a positive slippage (more favourable to you) or a negative slippage (less favourable to you).</p><h2 data-anchor="true">External forces</h2><p>Your forex and contracts for differences transactions with Binary.com are linked to an underlying financial instrument and you will be exposed to price, currency exchange, interest rate or other volatility of the market to which your financial instrument is related to, especially if the market is of a jurisdiction that is foreign to you. Forex and contracts for differences trading over the internet via an electronic trading platform is subject to data latency risk which may result in delays in order execution.</p><h2 data-anchor="true">Risk of cryptocurrency contracts for differences</h2><p>Cryptocurrencies are volatile assets that are extremely vulnerable to market fluctuations. Trading cryptocurrency contracts for differences is highly speculative investment because prices of cryptocurrencies can go up and down — potentially to a worthless (zero) value. Investing in cryptocurrency contracts for differences through leveraged accounts amplifies this underlying volatility risk, making the change in prices even more significant. When you invest in a leveraged contract for differences related to cryptocurrencies, your profit or loss is based on the leveraged ratio you set for your account. If the price movement is in your favour, returns generated are of multiple times higher than the amount set aside from your account balance to open and maintain a transaction. However, if the price movement is against your favour, you will suffer losses that are of multiple times higher than the amount set aside from your account balance to open and maintain a transaction. You should not trade in cryptocurrencies unless you fully understand and are aware that trades and / or investments involving cryptocurrencies are complex and high risk in nature and you not only risk incurring significant losses over a short period of time but also risk losing all your invested capital.</p></div></div><div id="order-execution-binary-content" class="toggle-content invisible"><div><h2 data-anchor="true">Summary Order Execution Policy</h2><p>We have a general duty to conduct our business with you honestly, fairly, and professionally and to act in your best interests when opening and closing Binary Options trades with you.</p><p>More specifically, when we enter into a Binary Option trade with you (each, a &quot;Contract&quot;), we have a duty to provide you with &#x27;best execution&#x27;. Best execution means that we must take reasonable steps to obtain the best possible result for you when executing an order with you. This document provides a summary of our best execution policy.</p><p>You should note that our duty to provide you with best execution does not apply to any gambling products that you place with us, where there is no underlying financial market.</p><h2 data-anchor="true">일반</h2><p>When we enter into Contracts with you, we will take all reasonable steps to achieve the best possible result for you by executing those Contracts according to our order execution policy and subject to any specific instructions received from you. Our order execution policy comprises a set of procedures that are designed to obtain the best possible execution result for you subject to and taking into account: (a) the nature of your Contracts, (b) the priorities you have identified to us in relation to entering into those Contracts, and (c) the practices relating to the market in question, with the aim of producing a result which provides, in our view, the best balance across a range of sometimes conflicting factors. Our policy cannot provide a guarantee, however, that when entering into Contracts with you, the price will always be better than one which is or might have been available elsewhere.</p><h2 data-anchor="true">Best Execution Factors</h2><p>In relation to Contracts that you enter into with us, we act as principal and not as agent on your behalf and we therefore act as the sole execution venue for the execution of your Contracts.</p><p>We are required to take a number of factors into account when considering how to give you best execution. We have rated price as the most important followed by: (a) costs; (b) size, (c) liquidity of the underlying market, (d) speed and (e) likelihood of execution and settlement. The main way in which we will ensure that you obtain best execution is by ensuring that in our calculation of our bid/offer prices, we pay due consideration to the market price for the underlying reference product to which your Contract relates. We have access to a number of different data sources in order to ascertain the market price, which is our objective view of the bids and offers available to arms&#x27; length traders.</p><p>In relation to some Contracts, at the time at which you give us an order there may be no functioning or open market or exchange on which the reference product is traded. In such cases, we set out to determine a fair underlying price based on a number of factors such as price movements on associated markets and other market influences and information about our clients&#x27; own orders.</p><h2 data-anchor="true">Specific Instructions</h2><p>Where you give us specific instructions, including for example (a) specifying the price of a Contract with us or (b) specifying the price at which a Contract is to be closed, then those instructions take precedence over other aspects of our policy.</p><h2 data-anchor="true">No fiduciary duty</h2><p>Our commitment to provide you with &#x27;best execution&#x27; does not mean that we owe you any fiduciary responsibilities over and above the specific regulatory obligations placed upon us or as may be otherwise contracted between us.</p><h2 data-anchor="true">Monitoring and review of this Policy</h2><p>We will monitor the effectiveness of our order execution arrangements and order execution policy. We will assess from time to time whether the venues relied upon by us in pricing our Contracts on your behalf allow us to achieve best execution on a consistent basis or whether we need to make changes to our execution arrangements. We will also review our order execution arrangements and order execution policy in respect of material changes either in respect of one of our chosen pricing venues or that otherwise affect our ability to continue to achieve best execution. Should there be any material changes to our order execution arrangements or order execution policy, we will notify you.</p></div></div><div id="order-execution-mt-content" class="toggle-content invisible"><div><h2 data-anchor="true">Order Execution Policy</h2><h2 data-anchor="true">A. Introduction</h2><p>The term &#x27;we&#x27;, &#x27;us&#x27;, &#x27;our&#x27;, &#x27;ours&#x27;, &#x27;the Company&#x27;, or &#x27;Binary.com&#x27; shall denote Binary (V) Ltd.</p><p>Our Order Execution Policy (the &quot;Policy&quot;) sets out the overview and approach of how Binary.com executes orders on behalf of our clients.</p><p>The Policy is supplemented by Appendix A which provide further details to our considerations as they are related to differing asset classes. The accompanying Appendix A should be read in conjunction with this Policy.</p><h2 data-anchor="true">B. Scope</h2><p>This Policy applies to retail and professional clients of Binary.com dealing in financial products offered by Binary.com.</p><h2 data-anchor="true">C. Definition of Best Execution</h2><p>Best execution is the requirement to take all sufficient steps to obtain, when executing orders, the best possible result for you taking into account price, costs, speed, likelihood of execution and settlement, size, nature or any other consideration relevant (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;execution factors&quot;) to the execution of the order.</p><h2 data-anchor="true">D. Client Instructions</h2><p>When we accept an order from you to open or close a transaction, or any other specific instructions in relation to your order, we will endeavour to follow your instructions as far as reasonably possible, acting in accordance with our duty of best execution in accordance with your instructions. These specific instructions include, but are not limited to:</p><ul><li>a) The venue at which your order will be executed;</li><li>b) The price at which your order will be executed;</li><li>c) The time at which your order will be executed; and</li><li>d) The timeframe or duration of the contract as defined by your order execution.</li></ul><p>Where a particular venue has been specified in your instructions with respect to the execution of an order, we will not be responsible for the venue selection.</p><p>Where a particular time or timeframe has been specified in a client&#x27;s instructions with respect to the execution of an order, regardless of the price available, we will endeavour to execute the order at the specified time or over the specified timeframe in the best possible manner after taking all sufficient steps. However, we will not be responsible for any consequences related to pricing that resulted from the time or timeframe of the execution.</p><p>Aspects of a client order not affected by specific instructions are subject to the application of Binary.com&#x27;s Order Execution Policy. In the absence of specific instructions from our clients, we will exercise our own discretion in determining the factors that are required to be taken into account for the purpose of providing you with best execution, having regard to the execution criteria listed below:</p><ul class="bullet"><li>the characteristics of the client;</li><li>the characteristics of the order;</li><li>the characteristics of financial instruments that are the subject of that order;</li><li class="no-bullet">and</li><li>the characteristics of the execution venues to which that order can be directed.</li></ul><h2 data-anchor="true">E. Best Execution Obligation</h2><p>Binary.com owes you a duty of best execution when executing orders on your behalf, i.e., when you are placing a legitimate reliance on us to safeguard your interest in relation to the execution of your order.</p><p>In executing orders on your behalf, Binary.com takes into consideration the following to achieve the best possible result for you:</p><ul class="bullet"><li>Price - the price at which the transaction in relation to your order is executed at.</li><li>Costs - the costs of executing your order comprised predominantly of spread, i.e., the difference between our bid and our offer price.</li><li>Speed - the speed at which your order can be executed.</li><li>Likelihood of execution and settlement - the depth of liquidity of the market in which your order is related to.</li><li>Size - the size of your order determined by the volume (number of lots).</li><li>Any other consideration relevant to the execution of the transaction.</li></ul><p>The factor listed above are not listed in order of priority. Ordinarily, price will merit a high relative importance in obtaining the best possible result for you. However, the relative importance of the listed factors above may change in accordance with:</p><ul class="bullet"><li>the specific instructions that we receive from you;</li><li>the market conditions of the financial instruments that your orders are related to, which includes the need for timely execution, availability of price improvement, liquidity of the market, size of your order, and the potential impact on total consideration.</li></ul><p>Our determination of the relative importance of the execution factors may differ from yours during certain circumstances, acting in your interest in accordance with our obligation of best execution.</p><h2 data-anchor="true">F. Execution Venues</h2><p>Binary.com offers forex and contracts for differences via the hybrid model, i.e., both dealing on own account (dealing desk) and partially hedging client orders with our liquidity providers (no-dealing desk).</p><p>When we deal on own account (dealing desk), we act as principal and not as an agent on your behalf and we therefore act as the execution venue.</p><p>Whilst we act as principal in respect of your orders, we also assess the execution venues that we use and upon which we place significant reliance to provide the best possible result for the execution of your orders. These venues typically consist of third party investment firms, brokers, and/or liquidity providers.</p><p>Binary.com assesses the choice of external execution venues regularly (at least once a year) with the intention of achieving a better result for you based on our best execution obligation.</p><h2 data-anchor="true">G. Order Handling</h2><p>All client orders are processed on a first in first out basis without any manual intervention. When executing your order, Binary.com will seek to fill your order transaction as promptly as possible, at the instructed price (or at a better price, if available). Exposure limits are established based on internal governance arrangements and risk management framework which commensurate with the size, nature, complexity, and risk profile of our activities. These exposure limits are used as benchmarks to distinguish orders that are auto-accepted and orders that will be worked in the market with fill level passed on to the client.</p><h2 data-anchor="true">H. Monitoring and Review</h2><p>We will monitor the effectiveness of our order execution arrangements and order execution policy. We will assess from time to time whether the venues relied upon by us in pricing our Contracts on your behalf allow us to achieve best execution on a consistent basis or whether we need to make changes to our execution arrangements. We will also review our order execution arrangements and order execution policy in respect of material changes either in respect of one of our chosen pricing venues or that otherwise affect our ability to continue to achieve best execution. Should there be any material changes to our order execution arrangements or order execution policy, we will notify you.</p><h2 data-anchor="true">Appendix - Product Specific Policies</h2><h2 data-anchor="true">A. Spot FX</h2><p>For features and trading illustration of Spot FX offered by Binary.com, refer to the Product Disclosure Statement. This policy is an appendix to the overarching Binary.com Order Execution Policy and should be read in conjunction with the overarching Binary.com Order Execution Policy.</p><p>Binary.com provides you best execution by utilising a smart aggregation method when managing incoming orders. The smart aggregation method works by:</p><ul class="bullet"><li>consolidating liquidity from several providers into a single stream of blended feed; and</li><li>intelligently routing incoming orders to different types of execution modes based on configurations and algorithms established using best execution factors.</li></ul><p>By default, the intelligent order routing system ensures that the top of the book is always comprised of the best bid and offer rates quoted by the competing liquidity providers. However, during times of market illiquidity, this may change with likelihood of execution being the primary execution factor.</p><p>Depending on the level of risk that we are exposed to acting as your counterparty, we largely act in a principal capacity of your trades. As such, the execution venue will usually be Binary.com. However, we may transmit your order to third party liquidity providers, in which case we will determine the execution venue ourselves on the basis described above.</p><p>The execution venues are assessed, on a regular basis, whether the they provide for the best possible result for our clients.</p></div></div><div id="payment-agents-content" class="toggle-content invisible"><div><h2 data-anchor="true">Payment Agents Terms and Conditions</h2><h2 data-anchor="true">A.
